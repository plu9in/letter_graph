# letter_graph

This code constructs a graph to materialize the links between letters.

The graph of this text would start like this:

    T->h->i->s 
             ^
             |
             n 
             ^ 
             |
          c->o->d-e

The links are links between letters; a counter defines the "force" of the link.
